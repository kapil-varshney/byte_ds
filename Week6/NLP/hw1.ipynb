    "Write a script to transform input CSV to desired output CSV. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find a CSV file available for download in this repo: test.csv. There are three steps to this part of the homework. Each step concerns manipulating the values for a single field according to the step's requirements. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- String cleaning - The bio field contains text with arbitrary padding, spacing and line breaks. Normalize these values to a space-delimited string.\n",
    "- Code swap - There is a supplementary CSV file for download here: state_abbreviations.csv. This \"data dictionary\" contains state abbreviations alongside state names. For the state field of the input CSV, replace each state abbreviation with its associated state name from the data dictionary.\n",
    "- Date offset - The start_date field contains data in a variety of formats. These may include e.g., \"June 23, 1912\" or \"5/11/1930\" (month, day, year). But not all values are valid dates. Invalid dates may include e.g., \"June 2018\", \"3/06\" (incomplete dates) or even arbitrary natural language. Add a start_date_description field adjacent to the start_date column to filter invalid date values into. Normalize all valid date values in start_date to ISO 8601 (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your script should take \"test.csv\" as input and produce a cleansed \"solution.csv\" file according to the step requirements above. Please attach your \"solution.csv\" file along with your solution code in your pull request!\n"
