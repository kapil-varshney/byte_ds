    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to use your ability to code to help you understand probability and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is the study of random events - the study of how likely it is that some event will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is the discipline that uses data to support claims about populations. Most statistical analysis is based on probability, which is why these pieces are usually presented together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection \n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection is the process of gathering data to answer relevant questions and evaluate outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive Statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics refers to statistics that summarize your data concisely and evaluate different ways to visualize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "During the process of exploratory data analysis, we look for patterns, differences, and other features that address the questions we are interested in. At the same time we will check for inconsistencies and identify limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis Testing \n",
    "\n",
    "When we evaluate a possible cause-and-effect relationship, like a difference between two groups, we will evaluate whether the effect is real or whether it might have happened by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimation \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation is what allows us to use data from a sample to estimate characteristics of the general population."
